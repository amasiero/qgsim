### Welcome to QGSIM Clustering Algorithm page.
This is a clustering algorithm based on similarity values. The main feature of QGSIM is that it keeps a quality between cluster's elements with a minimal similarity value. 

More about QGSIM can be found [here](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-39209-2_55)
